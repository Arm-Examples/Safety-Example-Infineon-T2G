# Blinky project

The **Blinky** project is a simple example that runs on the **Cortex-M7 Core 1** and just
blinks the LED2 with 500 ms interval.

This application runs on the **Infineon KIT_T2G-B-H_LITE** evaluation board (device: CYT4BF8CDDQ0AESGS, core: **Cortex-M7 Core 1**).

> Note: This application just shows independent operation of a CM7 core, in real-world application it would do meaningful work.
