# Boot project

The **Boot** project is a simple bootloader application that runs on the **Cortex-M0+** core
and **starts the two other Cortex-M7** cores, and it continues running an endless `for` loop.

This bootloader runs on the **Infineon KIT_T2G-B-H_LITE** evaluation board (device: CYT4BF8CDDQ0AESGS, core: **Cortex-M0+**).

> Note: The Cortex-M0+ core could continue doing useful work in a real-world application.
