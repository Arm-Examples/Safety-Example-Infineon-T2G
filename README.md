# Safety example for the Infineon TRAVEO T2G series

This repository contains a safety example that shows the usage of the [Arm Functional safety Run-Time System](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Keil%20MDK/FuSa%20Run-Time%20System) on Infineon hardware.

The traffic light example is configured for the [Infineon KIT_T2G-B-H_LITE](https://www.keil.arm.com/boards/infineon-kit-t2g-b-h-lite-v1-34ab4d8/features/) development board and uses the [MDK-Middleware](https://www.keil.arm.com/packs/mdk-middleware-keil/overview/) for network communication.

The example is based on the application note [KAN336 - TrafficLight: Arm FuSa RTS process isolation example](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/kan336/latest).
