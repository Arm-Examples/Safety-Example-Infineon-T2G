# Safety Example for Infineon TRAVEO T2G Series

This repository contains examples for [Keil Studio](https://www.keil.arm.com/) that run on the [Infineon Kit T2G-B-H_Lite](https://www.keil.arm.com/packs/kit_t2g-b-h_lite_bsp-infineon).

## Quick Start

1. Install [Keil Studio for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Arm.keil-studio-pack) from the VS Code marketplace.
2. Clone this Git repository into a VS Code workspace.
3. Open the CMSIS View in VS Code and use the ... menu *Select Active Solution from workspace* to choose a example.
4. The related tools and software packs are downloaded and installed. Review progress with *View - Output - CMSIS Solution*.
5. Using the [Action buttons in the CMSIS View](https://github.com/ARM-software/vscode-cmsis-csolution?tab=readme-ov-file#action-buttons) allows you to build, load and debug the example on the Infineon Kit.

## Examples

The examples can be explored using the [Keil MDK Community edition](https://www.keil.arm.com/keil-mdk/#mdk-v6-editions) that is free to use for training and evaluation. Instead of the commercial [FuSa RTS](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Keil%20MDK/FuSa%20Run-Time%20System) with is part of the [Keil MDK Professional edition](https://www.keil.arm.com/keil-mdk/#mdk-v6-editions) the open-source variant [Keil RTX](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Keil%20MDK/RTX5%20RTOS) is used for evaluation purposes.

### App/T2G

The [App/T2G.csolution.yml](./App/T2G.csolution.yml) safety example contains:

- [App/CM0p_Boot/Boot.cproject.yml](./App/CM0p_Boot/Boot.cproject.yml) implements a simple setup for the various processors and runs on the Cortex-M0+ processor of the device.
- [App/CM7_0_TrafficLight/TrafficLight.cproject.yml](./App/CM7_0_TrafficLight/TrafficLight.cproject.yml) implements the safety-critical application part using [FuSa RTS](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Keil%20MDK/FuSa%20Run-Time%20System) and runs on the Cortex-M7 processor #0.
- [App/CM7_1_Blinky/Blinky.cproject.yml](./App/CM7_1_Blinky/Blinky.cproject.yml) blinks an LED and could be replaced with non-safety application part and runs on the Cortex-M7 processor #1.

The safety-critical application part [CM7_0_TrafficLight](./App/CM7_0_TrafficLight/TrafficLight.cproject.yml) uses safety classes to protect safe-mode operation. A web server that interacts with the user allows you to inject faults for testing the system recovery features. This part of the example is based on the application note [KAN336 - TrafficLight: Arm FuSa RTS process isolation example](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/kan336/latest).

### Test/Ethernet/DriverTest

The Infineon DFP/BSP software packs do not contain a [CMSIS-Driver Ethernet](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_6/latest/Driver/group__eth__interface__gr.html) or [board software layers](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/cmsis-toolbox/ReferenceApplications/#board-layer). These components are therefore developed separately and provided in this repository.

The [Test/Ethernet/DriverTest.csolution.yml](./Test/Ethernet/DriverTest.csolution.yml) validates the CMSIS-Driver Ethernet with the [CMSIS-Driver_Validation](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS-Driver_Validation) pack.
